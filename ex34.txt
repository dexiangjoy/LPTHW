animals = ['bear', 'tiger', 'penguin', 'zebra']
bear = animals[0]

cardinal number :  n. the number of elements in a mathematical set; denotes a quantity but not the order
Programmers, however, can't think this way because they can pick any element out of a list at any point.
To programmers, the list of animals is more like a deck of cards. If they want the tiger, they grab it. If they want the zebra, they can take it too.
This need to pull elements out of lists at random means that they need a way to indicate elements consistently by an address, or an "index,"
and the best way to do that is to start the indices at 0. Trust me on this: the math is way easier for these kinds of accesses.
This kind of number is a "cardinal" number and means you can pick at random, so there needs to be a 0 element.

How does this help you work with lists? Simple, every time you say to yourself, "I want the third animal,"
you translate this "ordinal" number to a "cardinal" number by subtracting 1. The "third" animal is at index 2 and is the penguin.
You have to do this because you have spent your whole life using ordinal numbers, and now you have to think in cardinal. Just subtract 1 and you will be good.

Remember: ordinal == ordered, 1st; cardinal == cards at random, 0.
